This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

take this whole file code.
make it for next js frontend.
make it like folder/page.js and folder/components/componets here
we will pass data from page.js to these components - the repetivite data used in ui. to not duplicate ui codes - passign from main page.
fix all things errs etc.
make components of that page each section.
only of section parts.
replace the icons with lucide - react icon library icons.
keep whole ui as it. just break in components, optimize with using objects of data and passing them and use lucide-react icons
don't remove minor details etc designigs etc in banners too or in any section - keep all stuff as professional as is given. for primary-orange-dark use orange-700 and instead of jaaz-orange or jaaz-primary use primary-orange colors. this sort of.
leave the hero section, banner, background section and cta section.
they are already setup by me.

make rest components and use them in folder/page.js
see the current done part of page.js and components are left to make yet. make them by extracting.
